## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### 🆕 Debug Logging (v1.16)

**NEW**: ExodusAI now includes comprehensive debug logging to help identify network issues:

1. **Access Debug Logs**:
   - Go to Settings → "View Debug Logs"
   - Real-time monitoring of all network activity
   - Color-coded log levels (Network/Info/Warning/Error/Debug)

2. **Troubleshoot "Demo Mode Active"**:
   - Send a test message to generate logs
   - Look for connection errors in the debug screen
   - Copy logs using the share button for technical support
   - Check for specific error patterns (timeout, refused, DNS issues)

3. **Common Debug Log Patterns**:
   - `[NET] Connection failed: ConnectException` = Server not reachable
   - `[NET] HTTP 404` = Wrong API endpoint
   - `[ERROR] Network connection failed` = General connectivity issue
   - `[NET] Response code: 200` = Successful connection

### Android 16 QPR2 Specific Issues

1. **APK Installation Failures**:
   - ✅ Use **APK v1.17** specifically designed for QPR2
   - ✅ Install via **ADB**: `adb install app-debug.apk`
   - ✅ Enable **Developer Options** and **USB debugging**
   - ✅ Check **"Install unknown apps"** for ADB/file manager
   - ✅ Temporarily disable **"Verify apps over USB"** in Developer Options

2. **Enhanced Security Restrictions**:
   - ✅ QPR2 has stricter APK validation - use correct API 36 build
   - ✅ Enable **"Allow from this source"** when prompted
   - ✅ Check **Security & Privacy → More security settings**
   - ✅ Some QPR2 builds require **manual permission grants**

3. **Parsing Package Errors**:
   - ✅ Ensure using **v1.17** (not older versions)
   - ✅ Clear download cache and re-download APK
   - ✅ Try different transfer method (USB instead of WhatsApp)
   - ✅ Verify QPR2 build number in About Phone

### Common Issues (All Android Versions)

1. **"Demo mode active" / Connection Issues**:
   - ✅ **NEW**: Use Debug Logs in Settings to see exact error details
   - ✅ Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
   - ✅ Check network connectivity (try: `ping 192.168.0.115`)
   - ✅ Verify models are downloaded: `ollama list`
   - ✅ Copy debug logs for technical support

2. **Connection timeout or network errors**:
   - ✅ **NEW**: Monitor real-time connection attempts in Debug Logs
   - ✅ Verify Ollama allows external connections: `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ollama serve`
   - ✅ Try different IP address in app configuration
   - ✅ Disable firewalls temporarily for testing
   - ✅ Check if port 11434 is accessible

3. **Theme not switching**:
   - ✅ Restart the app after changing theme in Settings
   - ✅ Clear app data if theme preference is stuck

4. **Models not loading after update**:
   - ✅ Refresh models list using the update button
   - ✅ Restart Ollama service: `ollama serve`
   - ✅ Check Ollama logs for errors

### Network Debugging

**Legacy debugging** (v1.16 includes better built-in tools):

Enable detailed logging in debug builds:

1. **Check Android Logcat** for network errors:
   ```bash
   adb logcat -s ExodusAI
   ```

2. **Test Ollama connectivity** from terminal:
   ```bash
   # Test basic connectivity
   curl http://192.168.0.115:11434/api/tags
   
   # Test chat endpoint
   curl -X POST http://192.168.0.115:11434/api/chat \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"model": "llama2", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'
   ```

3. **Common network fixes**:
   - Restart WiFi on both devices
   - Use `ipconfig`/`ifconfig` to verify IP addresses
   - Check router settings for device isolation
