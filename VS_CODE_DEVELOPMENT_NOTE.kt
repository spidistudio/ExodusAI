/**
 * Exodus Development Notice
 * 
 * If you're seeing "Unresolved reference" errors in VS Code, this is normal!
 * These errors occur because VS Code doesn't fully recognize Android/Gradle projects
 * like Android Studio does.
 * 
 * THE CODE WILL STILL COMPILE AND WORK when built with Gradle!
 * 
 * To resolve VS Code issues:
 * 1. Install Android Studio for full development
 * 2. Or use IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (free)
 * 3. Or continue with VS Code and ignore the red squiggly lines
 * 
 * The web preview shows exactly how the app will look!
